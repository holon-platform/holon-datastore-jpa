== Introduction

The Holon *JPA Datastore* is the _Java Persistence API_ reference implementation of the link:{coreapidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/Datastore.html[Datastore^] API. 

TIP: See the link:holon-core.html#Datastore[Datastore^] documentation for further information about the Datastore `API`.

The JPA `Datastore` uses the  link:https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/EntityManagerFactory.html[EntityManagerFactory^] API as a factory to obtain link:https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/EntityManager.html[EntityManager^] API instances to perform data access and management operations through the standard JPA `JPQL` language and the `EntityManager` API operations.

IMPORTANT: The Holon Platform JPA modules and components require *JPA version 2.0 or higher*, so a JPA 2.0+  compliant persistence provider (ORM) is needed at runtime.

=== Sources and contributions

The Holon Platform *JPA Datastore* module source code is available from the GitHub repository link:https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-datastore-jpa[https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-datastore-jpa^].

See the repository `README` file for information about:

* The source code structure.
* How to build the module artifacts from sources.
* Where to find the code examples.
* How to contribute to the module development.

== Obtaining the artifacts

The Holon Platform uses https://maven.apache.org[Maven^] for projects build and configuration. All the platform artifacts are published in the *Maven Central Repository*, so there is no need to explicitly declare additional repositories in your project `pom` file.

At the top of each _section_ of this documentation you will find the Maven _coordinates_ (group id, artifact id and version) to obtain the artifact(s) as a dependency for your project.

A *BOM (Bill Of Materials)* `pom` is provided to import the available dependencies for a specific version in your projects. The Maven coordinates for the core BOM are the following:

_Maven coordinates_:
[source, xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
<groupId>com.holon-platform.jpa</groupId>
<artifactId>holon-datastore-jpa-bom</artifactId>
<version>{revnumber}</version>
----

The BOM can be imported in a Maven project in the following way:

[source, xml, subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes+"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.holon-platform.jpa</groupId>
			<artifactId>holon-datastore-jpa-bom</artifactId>
			<version>{revnumber}</version>
			*<type>pom</type>*
			*<scope>import</scope>*
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

=== Using the Platform BOM

The Holon Platform provides an *overall Maven BOM (Bill of Materials)* to easily obtain all the available platform artifacts.

See link:index.html#obtain-the-platform-artifacts[Obtain the platform artifacts] for details.

[[WhatsNew51x]]
== What's new in version 5.1.x

* The new link:holon-jpa.html[JPA support module^] can be used to integrate the JPA data model definition with the Holon Platform link:holon-core.html#Property[Property model^]. See link:holon-jpa.html#JPAPostProcessors[JPA entity bean post processors^].

* Full support for date and time *functions* and for `java.time.*` temporal types. See link:holon-core.html#TemporalFunctions[Datastore API temporal functions support^].

* Technology-independent *transactions* support through the `Transactional` API. See <<Transactions>>.

* Complete and deep revision and rewriting of the internal *JPQL composer engine*. This ensures more consistent operation resolution strategies, remarkable performance improvements and extensibility by design. See <<JPADatastoreExtension>>.

* Improved support for link:http://openjpa.apache.org[Apache OpenJPA^] and link:http://www.datanucleus.org[Datanucleus^] ORMs, along with the standard support for *Hibernate* and *Eclipselink*.

== Loggers

By default, the Holon platform uses the https://www.slf4j.org[SLF4J^] API for logging. The use of SLF4J is optional: it is enabled when the presence of SLF4J is detected in the classpath. Otherwise, logging will fall back to JUL (`java.util.logging`).

The logger name for the *JPA Datastore* module is `com.holonplatform.datastore.jpa`.

== System requirements

=== Java

The Holon Platform JPA Datastore module requires https://www.java.com[Java^] *8* or higher.

=== JPA

The *Java Persistence API version 2.0 or higher* is required for the JPA Datastore module proper use. To use most recent JPA features, such as _left joins_ and the _ON_ clause, the *Java Persistence API version 2.1* is required.

=== Persistence providers

Altough any JPA 2.0 or higher compliant persistence provider (ORM) is supported, the Holon Platform JPA Datastore module is tested and certified with the followings:

* http://hibernate.org/orm[Hibernate ORM^] version *4.x* or *5.x*
* http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink[EclipseLink^] version *2.5 or higher*
* http://openjpa.apache.org[Apache OpenJPA^] version *2.4 or higher*
* http://www.datanucleus.org[Datanucleus^] version *5.1 or higher*
