== Introduction

The Holon *JPA Datastore* is the _Java Persistence API_ reference implementation of the link:../../api/holon-core/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/Datastore.html[Datastore^] abstraction. 

TIP: See the link:holon-core.html#Datastore[Datastore] documentation for further informations about Datastores.

This `Datastore` uses the JPA link:https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/EntityManagerFactory.html[EntityManagerFactory] interface as a factory to obtain link:https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/EntityManager.html[EntityManager] instances, used by the `Datastore` to perform persistence operations and queries through the `JPQL` language.

IMPORTANT: The Holon Platform JPA modules and components require *JPA 2.0 or higher*, so a JPA 2.0/2.1 compliant persistence provider is needed at runtime.

NOTE: To use a JPA Datastore, an link:https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/EntityManagerFactory.html[EntityManagerFactory] instance must be configured and available. `EntityManagerFactory` setup (including any ORM platform configuration concerns) is beyond the scope of this documentation.

== Obtaining the artifacts

The Holon Platform uses https://maven.apache.org[Maven^] for projects build and configuration. All the platform artifacts are published in the *Maven Central Repository*, so there is no need to explicitly declare additional repositories in your project `pom` file.

At the top of each _section_ of this documentation you will find the Maven _coordinates_ (group id, artifact id and version) to obtain the artifact(s) as a dependency for your project.

A *BOM (Bill Of Materials)* `pom` is provided to import the available dependencies for a specific version in your projects. The Maven coordinates for the core BOM are the following:

_Maven coordinates_:
[source, xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
<groupId>com.holon-platform.jpa</groupId>
<artifactId>holon-datastore-jpa-bom</artifactId>
<version>{revnumber}</version>
----

The BOM can be imported in a Maven project in the following way:

[source, xml, subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes+"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.holon-platform.jpa</groupId>
			<artifactId>holon-datastore-jpa-bom</artifactId>
			<version>{revnumber}</version>
			*<type>pom</type>*
			*<scope>import</scope>*
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

=== Using the Platform BOM

The Holon Platform provides an *overall Maven BOM (Bill of Materials)* to easily obtain all the available platform artifacts.

See link:index.html#obtain-the-platform-artifacts[Obtain the platform artifacts] for details.

// Inclusions

include::_datastore.adoc[]

include::_spring.adoc[]

== Loggers

By default, the Holon platform uses the https://www.slf4j.org[SLF4J^] API for logging. The use of SLF4J is optional: it is enabled when the presence of SLF4J is detected in the classpath. Otherwise, logging will fall back to JUL (`java.util.logging`).

The logger name for the *JPA Datastore* module is `com.holonplatform.datastore.jpa`.

== System requirements

=== Java

The Holon Platform JPA Datastore module requires https://www.java.com[Java] *8* or higher.

=== JPA

The *Java Persistence API version 2.0 or higher* is required for the JPA Datastore module proper use. To use most recent JPA features, such as _left joins_ and the _ON_ clause, the *Java Persistence API version 2.1* is required.

=== Persistence providers

Altough any JPA 2.0 or higher compliant persistence provider (ORM) is supported, the Holon Platform JPA Datastore module is tested and certified with the followings:

* http://hibernate.org/orm[Hibernate ORM] version *4.x* or *5.x*
* http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink[EclipseLink] version *2.5 or higher*
